		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
		
		   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

				       Version 2.1, February 1999
		
		 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
		     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
		 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
		 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
		
		[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
		 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
		 the version number 2.1.]
		
					    Preamble
		
		  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
		freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
		Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
		free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
		
		  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
		specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
		Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
		can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
		this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
		strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
		
		  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
		not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
		you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
		for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
		it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
		it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
		these things.
		
		  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
		distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
		rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
		you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
		
		  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
		or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
		you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
		code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
		complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
		with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
		it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
		
		  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
		library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
		permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
		
		  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
		there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
		modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
		that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
		author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
		introduced by others.
		
		  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
		any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
		effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
		restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
		any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
		consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
		
		  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
		ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
		General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
		is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
		this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
		libraries into non-free programs.
		
		  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
		a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
		combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
		General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
		entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
		Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
		the library.
		
		  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
		does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
		Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
		of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
		are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
		libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
		special circumstances.
		
		  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
		encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
		a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
		allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
		library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
		case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
		software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
		
		  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
		programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
		free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
		non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
		operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
		system.
		
		  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
		users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
		linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
		that program using a modified version of the Library.
		
		  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
		modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
		"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
		former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
		be combined with the library in order to run.
		
				  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
		
		  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
		program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
		other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
		this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
		Each licensee is addressed as "you".
		
		  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
		prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
		(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
		
		  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
		which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
		Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
		copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
		portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
		straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
		included without limitation in the term "modification".)
		
		  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
		making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
		all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
		interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
		and installation of the library.
		
		  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
		covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
		running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
		such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
		on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
		writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
		and what the program that uses the Library does.
		  
		  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
		complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
		you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
		appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
		all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
		warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
		Library.
		
		  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
		and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
		fee.
		
		  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
		of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
		distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
		above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
		
		    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
		
		    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
		    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
		
		    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
		    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
		
		    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
		    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
		    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
		    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
		    in the event an application does not supply such function or
		    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
		    its purpose remains meaningful.
		
		    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
		    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
		    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
		    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
		    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
		    root function must still compute square roots.)
		
		These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
		identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
		and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
		themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
		sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
		distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
		on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
		this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
		entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
		it.
		
		Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
		your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
		exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
		collective works based on the Library.
		
		In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
		with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
		a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
		the scope of this License.
		
		  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
		License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
		this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
		that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
		instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
		ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
		that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
		these notices.
		
		  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
		that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
		subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
		
		  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
		the Library into a program that is not a library.
		
		  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
		derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
		under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
		it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
		must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
		medium customarily used for software interchange.
		
		  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
		from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
		source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
		distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
		compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
		
		  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
		Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
		linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
		work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
		therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
		
		  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
		creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
		contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
		library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
		Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
		
		  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
		that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
		derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
		Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
		linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
		threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
		
		  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
		structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
		functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
		file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
		work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
		Library will still fall under Section 6.)
		
		  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
		distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
		Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
		whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
		
		  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
		link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
		work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
		under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
		modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
		engineering for debugging such modifications.
		
		  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
		Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
		this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
		during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
		copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
		directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
		of these things:
		
		    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
		    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
		    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
		    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
		    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
		    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
		    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
		    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
		    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
		    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
		    to use the modified definitions.)
		
		    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
		    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
		    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
		    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
		    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
		    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
		    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
		
		    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
		    least three years, to give the same user the materials
		    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
		    than the cost of performing this distribution.
		
		    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
		    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
		    specified materials from the same place.
		
		    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
		    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
		
		  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
		Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
		reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
		the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
		normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
		components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
		which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
		the executable.
		
		  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
		restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
		accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
		use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
		distribute.
		
		  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
		Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
		facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
		library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
		the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
		permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
		
		    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
		    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
		    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
		    Sections above.
		
		    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
		    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
		    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
		
		  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
		the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
		attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
		distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
		rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
		or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
		terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
		
		  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
		signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
		distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
		prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
		modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
		Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
		all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
		the Library or works based on it.
		
		  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
		Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
		original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
		subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
		restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
		You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
		this License.
		
		  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
		infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
		conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
		otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
		excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
		distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
		License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
		may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
		license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
		all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
		the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
		refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
		
		If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
		particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
		and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
		
		It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
		patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
		such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
		integrity of the free software distribution system which is
		implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
		generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
		through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
		system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
		to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
		impose that choice.
		
		This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
		be a consequence of the rest of this License.
		
		  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
		certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
		original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
		an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
		so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
		excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
		written in the body of this License.
		
		  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
		versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
		Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
		but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
		
		Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
		specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
		"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
		conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
		the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
		license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
		the Free Software Foundation.
		
		  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
		programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
		write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
		copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
		Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
		decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
		of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
		and reuse of software generally.
		
					    NO WARRANTY
		
		  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
		WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
		EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
		OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
		KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
		IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
		PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
		LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
		THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
		
		  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
		WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
		AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
		FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
		CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
		LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
		RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
		FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
		SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
		DAMAGES.
		
				     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
		
		           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
		
		  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
		possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
		everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
		redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
		ordinary General Public License).
		
		  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
		safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
		convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
		"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
		
		    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
		    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
		
		    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
		    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
		    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
		    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
		
		    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
		    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
		    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
		    Lesser General Public License for more details.
		
		    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
		    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
		    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
		
		Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
		
		You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
		school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
		necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
		
		  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
		  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
		
		  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
		  Ty Coon, President of Vice
		
		That's all there is to it!

		Our Copyright Policy
		--------------------
		Nucleic uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
		over their contributions to Nucleic. But, it is important to note that these
		contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Nucleic
		source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
		institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Nucleic
		Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
		changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
		their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
		change to one of the Nucleic repositories.
		
		With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
		to indicate the copyright and license terms:
		
		#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		\# Copyright (c) 2013, Nucleic Development Team.
		#
		\# Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.
		#
		\# The full license is in the file LICENSE, distributed with this software.

		                           Version 2.0, January 2004
		                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/
		
		   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
		
		   1. Definitions.
		
		      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
		      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
		
		      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
		      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
		
		      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
		      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
		      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
		      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
		      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
		      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
		      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
		
		      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
		      exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		      source, and configuration files.
		
		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
		
		   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
		
		      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
		      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
		      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
		      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
		      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
		      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
		      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
		      identification within third-party archives.

		   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
		
		   1. Definitions.
		
		      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
		      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
		
		      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
		      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
		
		      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
		      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
		      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
		      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
		      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
		      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

		      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
		      exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		      source, and configuration files.
		
		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
		
		   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
		
		      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
		      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
		      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
		      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
		      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
		      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
		      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
		      identification within third-party archives.

		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

		      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
		      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
		      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

		      exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		      source, and configuration files.
		
		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
		
		   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

        A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
		==========================
		
		Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
		Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
		as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
		principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
		
		In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
		National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
		in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
		software.
		
		In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
		BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
		year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
		Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
		Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
		non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
		Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
		the PSF.
		
		All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
		the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
		releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
		the various releases.
		
		    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
		                    from                                compatible? (1)
		
		    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
		    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
		    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
		    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
		    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
		    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
		    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
		    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
		    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
		    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
		    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes
		
		Footnotes:
		
		(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
		    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
		    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
		    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
		    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
		
		(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
		    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
		    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
		    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
		
		Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
		direction to make these releases possible.

		   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
		
		   1. Definitions.
		
		      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
		      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

		      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
		
		      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
		      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
		      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

		      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
		      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

		      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
		      exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		      source, and configuration files.
		
		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
